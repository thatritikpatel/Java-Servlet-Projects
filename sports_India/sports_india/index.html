                <p class="middle">A non-governmental organization (NGO) is a non-profit, citizen-based group that functions independently of government. NGOs, sometimes called civil societies, are organized on community,n his honor, this day also celebrated as India’s National Sports Day, where various sports heroes of the country are felicitated. The celebration also, in a way, underscores the importance of developing a positive attitude towards sports, encouraging the popularity of games and sports and providing an opportunity to youngsters to prove their mettle at whatever sports they might be playing.

                    Inarguably, there is no dearth of sports talent in India, but we need to know how to convert these yet-to-be-discovered players into world-class sportspersons. While there are issues about infrastructure and facilities provided to players, the positives are that despite the lack of funds, there is a hunger within the sportsperson to win and do well for India.
                    
                    When we, at LetsEndorse, began this search of some of the voluntary organizations, which are nurturing the hitherto hidden sports talents of the nation, we were appalled by the sheer minority of them. This speaks for itself. Nonetheless, we talked to some of them and this is what they had to say:</p>

                <p class="middle">We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” The team at GoSports Foundation believes firmly in this adage, and also believes that athletes who are working to achieve their potential can inspire countless others to strive for excellence. Through our work and the support we extend, we also foster better health and overall well-being for our athletes, a level playing field for all genders, and an inclusive society overall by also supporting able-bodied as well as differently-abled athletes. All of the above are in line with the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations for all member nations including India.”</p>

                <p class="middle">This athletic competition was conceptualised to inculcate a spirit of competition and sportsmanship in children and to push them to challenge themselves and surpass their limitations. It also provides an opportunity for NGOs to interact with each other. For instance, in Mumbai over 600 children from different NGOs participate in the Inter NGO Sports Meet each year.

                    Organised by Secure Giving, the event has the Athletics Federation of India as its technical partner in Mumbai and Delhi , the Karnataka Athletics Association as its partner in Bangalore as well as other athletic federations in the other cities.</p>
